# Contributing to Sentinel

## IRONCLAD Provenance Standard

All data in the Sentinel graph must trace to public federal sources. This is non-negotiable.

**Accepted sources:** Government databases (FEC, SEC, House/Senate disclosures, FARA, USAspending, Federal Register, CourtListener, Congress.gov, Voteview), court documents, DOJ press releases, verified Congressional records.

**Not accepted:** Scraped private data, leaked documents, unverifiable claims, social media posts, anonymous tips, or speculative analysis presented as fact.

## Code Standards

- Python 3.12+
- Type hints on all function signatures
- Docstrings on all public functions
- Tests for new features
- No hardcoded credentials

## Principles

- Accuracy over speed
- No partisan framing — the data speaks for itself
- Respect privacy of non-public figures
- Report both positive and negative results
- Every claim must be verifiable
